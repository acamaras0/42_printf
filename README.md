# 42_printf

To compile, run **make**. This will compile libftprintf.a. 
To use (no idea why would you wanna do that tho), include **ft_printf.h** (located inside includes directory) and use just like printf.

Then compile with a program:


***gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra main.c libftprintf.a -I includes***
